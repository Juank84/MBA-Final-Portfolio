It avoided the blank-page phenomenon and brought out choices that I could either embrace or discard or improvise. Micro-edits. When my bullet sounded vague I requested two tighter rewrit 1s using my own figures. That retained the voice mine plus tightened phrasing Table bullet translation equipped with All I did with Projects was to paste something rough and request a Context / Problem / Approach / Outcome rewrite, which I then edited line-by-line.\nNot helpful Generic language. It is not uncommon that drafts appear as boilerplate of corporate speak I edit what I would not write face-to-face. Unsupported claims. Where it was unclear whether a draft implied an impact that I could not definitively prove, I deleted, or placed a clear assumption note."
